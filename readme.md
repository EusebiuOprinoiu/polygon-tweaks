# Polygon Tweaks

Polygon Tweaks is a simple plugin with tweaks and fixes for a better experience on your WordPress website.

## Media Tweaks

- set image quality to 100% for new thumbnails (to prevent double compression while using plugins like ShortPixel or Imagify use lossless compression)
- add new thumbnail sizes for better adaptive images at common media queries (640px, 960px, 1280px, 1920px, 2560px)
- remove useless thumbnail sizes created by WordPress
- set big image size threshold at 3840px

For best results, use the following sizes under Settings > Media:
- Medium: 640 x 0
- Large: 1280 x 0

## Login Tweaks

- skip login page for logged-in users when using iThemes Security and a custom login URL
- change login logo and target URL

## Other Tweaks

- disable Jetpack and WooCommerce nags and upsells
